We believe that is not any difference between virtual and physical things in the era of internet connected things.\r\n\r\n### examples\r\nConnected devices will automatically show up on your remote.\r\n\r\n### device selection\r\nWhich devices that show up will be dependent on your location, network connection or user account.\r\nTrigger can be setup according to your needs. Imagen never getting home to a dark house.\r\n\r\n### Integrations\r\nAt the moment we have a integration to Telldus tellstick that takes all your devices connected to it and register them to everymote. We also have a remote controle for Spotify that lets you do the basic stuff you usually expect frome a remote control. There is also work on a plugin for web players such as youtify to easy connect to everymote.\r\n\r\n### keep me posted\r\nTODO\r\n\r\n### founders\r\n@_macke_ \r\n@sidpiraya \r\n@PCollazo\r\n\r\n### contact us\r\ncontact@everymote.com","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
